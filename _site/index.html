<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Epirus provides everything you need to deploy, run and integrate with a blockchain in production.</p>

<p>This repository contains a bundled distribution of some of the core components of the platform making it 
really straight-forwards to run the plaform locally and start developing decentralised apps (DApps) 
on the blockchain.</p>

<p>Please contact us if If youâ€™d like to use the full version of the platform that includes on 
premise/cloud/SaaS deployments, integrated authentication and support services.</p>

<h1 id="how-epirus-works">How Epirus works</h1>

<p>Epirus is a platform that provides developers of all levels with a basic blockchain environment 
for developing Decentralized Applications [Dapps]. It encapsulates four Quorum* 
[I would explain here that quorum is a permissioned for of Ethereum and also explain what a 
permissioned fork means ] blockchain nodes. One RESTful API that developers use to send data straight 
to the nodes. As far as the client side is considered, Epirus encapsulates a mongoDB database which is 
used to store the same data that is present on blockchain and a Blockchain explorer for an easy 
visualisation of blocks, contracts and transactions.</p>
