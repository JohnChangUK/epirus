# Epirus 

## Introduction

Epirus provides everything you need to deploy, run and integrate with a blockchain in production.

This repository contains a bundled distribution of some of the core components of the platform making it 
really straight-forwards to run the plaform locally and start developing decentralised apps (DApps) 
on the blockchain.

Please contact us if If you'd like to use the full version of the platform that includes on 
premise/cloud/SaaS deployments, integrated authentication and support services.

> For basic information about these components check the [Reference page]({{ "/5-reference.html" | absolute_url }}).


# How Epirus works

Epirus is a platform that provides developers of all levels with a basic blockchain environment 
for developing Decentralized Applications [Dapps]. It encapsulates four Quorum* 
[I would explain here that quorum is a permissioned for of Ethereum and also explain what a 
permissioned fork means ] blockchain nodes. One RESTful API that developers use to send data straight 
to the nodes. As far as the client side is considered, Epirus encapsulates a mongoDB database which is 
used to store the same data that is present on blockchain and a Blockchain explorer for an easy 
visualisation of blocks, contracts and transactions.
